Given sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, ...

Step 1: Look at the differences
- 6 − 2 = 4  
- 12 − 6 = 6  
- 20 − 12 = 8  

So the differences are +4, +6, +8, which are increasing by 2 each time.

---

Step 2: Find the next differences
- Next difference = 10  
- Then next difference = 12  

---

Step 3: Add them to continue the sequence
- 20 + 10 = 30 
- 30 + 12 = 42

---

Final Answer
The next two terms are: 30,42
