You have 3 switches in one room and 1 bulb in another room.  
You can go into the bulb room only once.

Steps:
1. Turn Switch A ON and leave it ON for like 10 minutes.
2. Turn Switch A OFF.
3. Turn Switch B ON.
4. Now go to the bulb room.
   - If the bulb is ON - it’s controlled by Switch B.
   - If the bulb is OFF but warm - it’s controlled by Switch A.
   - If the bulb is OFF and cold - it’s controlled by Switch C.
Why this works:
- Heat tells you if a switch was ON earlier(A).
- Light tells you if a switch is ON right now (B).
- If neither light nor heat - the unused switch (C) must be the one.
