We implemented string reversal in two ways:

1. Iterative method  
   - Start from the end of the string.  
   - Moves each character to a new string until the start is reached.  

2. Recursive method
   - Base case: if the string is empty, return it.  
   - Otherwise, take the last character and add it to the reverse of the substring (everything except the last character).  

Both methods return the reversed string.
