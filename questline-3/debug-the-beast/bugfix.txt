The old code had two problems:
1. It started with -9999999 which is not safe if numbers are smaller.
2. It could give wrong answer when the largest number is repeated.

My fix:
- I used set() to remove duplicates.
- Then I sorted the list and picked the second last element as the answer.
- This way it is simple and works for all cases.
